# uBiTXv6

This project is found at https://github.com/reedbn/ubitxv6/

It was forked from https://github.com/afarhan/ubitxv6/

The purpose of this project is to clean up (modularize) the source code, and add features that were not present
in Ashhar's original version of the project, without requiring any hardware modifications to a stock uBiTXv6.
