# ubitxv6 firmware for HERMES project
Based on uBitx v6.3.1 Arduino code by Ashhar Farhan

- This uses pins A6 and A7 for forward and reflected references measures, shown in the screen instead of CW settings
- Band filter settings are adjusted so that the transceiver works between 5 and 7 MHz
- PTT is disabled, as the plan is to use just CAT over serial, CW Keyer is disabled, as we use A6 for SWR measurements
